        To create new chess moves, use short Algebraic Notation (see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_notation_(chess)). In many cases, this simply means using the letter of the piece you are moving followed by its destination. Consider the following examples:

        `move Kc4` (move king to c4)
        `move e4` (move pawn to e4)
        `move Nxf5` (move knight to f5 capturing an opponent's piece)
        `move O-O` (perform a short castling)
        `move d8=Q` (move pawn to d8 and promote it to a queen)

        Sometimes, however, it is necessary to disambiguate between moves. In that case, simply append the starting file and/or rank to your move notation:

        `move Bac4` (move bishop in file a to c4)
        `move R1d1` (move rook in rank 1 to c4)
        `move Qh1xg2` (move queen at h1 to g2 capturing a piece)

        King = `K`, Queen = `Q`, Rook = `R`, Bishop = `B`, Knight = `N`, Pawn = no letter
